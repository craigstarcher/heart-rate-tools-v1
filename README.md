# Heart Rate Tools

## Project Description
Based off an introductory knowledge of java, it was an excerise that helped work through the logic for
developing a heart rate based alarm clock, timer, and stop watch. The alarm will wake you like any normal
alarm, but it will not turn off until your heart rate reaches a certian level. The timer and stop watch
only count up or down while the users heart rate is above the minimum heart rate for the zone they selected.
